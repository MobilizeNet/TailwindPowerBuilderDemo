Tailwind Traders, a forward-thinking retail business with a diverse set of needs. This business highlights various challenges real-world organizations face as they modernize and transform. The challenges should be familiar to you and your business even if the details differ.

The company wants to hosts its entire infrastructure on Microsoft Azure, and serves as the blueprint for modern retail.



Northwind Traders kept the bulk of its data in an on-premises data center, which hosted servers running both SQL Server and MongoDB. With some applications running on legacy platforms like Powerbuilder.

After the acquisition, Tailwind Traders worked with the Northwind team to move their data center entirely to Azure.

As part of this process they modernized their Powerbuilder to Java in order to host it on Azure.

This repository holds the original Powerbuilder application.

This application uses datawindow controls to edit the product catalog, and it used dropdown datawindows to display the master-detail relationship with the brands, types and tags tables.
